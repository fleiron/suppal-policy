  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><em>Last updated: November 30, 2025</em></p>

  <p>Welcome to **SuppPal: Vitamins, Meds & More** (the "App"). We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting it.</p>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>The App does **not collect personally identifiable information** (such as your name, email, or phone number). Any data you enter within the App, such as details about your supplements, intake schedules, or wishlist items, is stored **locally** on your device and is never transmitted to our servers or any external parties.</p>
  <p>We may collect **anonymized technical and usage data** for analytics and crash reporting, which helps us improve the App. This data may include:
    <ul>
      <li>App version and device model</li>
      <li>Usage patterns (e.g., which features are accessed)</li>
      <li>Subscription events (via RevenueCat)</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <h2>2. Subscriptions and Payments</h2>
  <p>The App offers premium features through in-app subscriptions, securely processed by Apple. We do not collect or store your payment information, as all transactions are handled directly by Apple's secure payment system.</p>
  <p>Subscription status is managed via **RevenueCat**, a third-party service that helps us administer in-app purchases. RevenueCat uses anonymous User IDs and may utilize device identifiers solely for fraud prevention and subscription validation purposes.</p>

  <h2>3. Push Notifications</h2>
  <p>The App does not use push notifications.</p>

  <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
  <p>We adhere to industry-standard practices to ensure the integrity and security of your data. Since the App primarily stores data locally on your device and does not collect personal data, privacy risks are significantly minimized.</p>

  <h2>5. Sharing Your Information</h2>
  <p>We do not sell, rent, or share any personal data with third parties. Anonymized subscription-related events may be shared with RevenueCat strictly to operate and support in-app purchases.</p>

  <h2>6. Your Rights</h2>
  <p>You have full control over the data stored on your device. You can manage your subscription or cancel it at any time through your Apple ID account settings.</p>

  <h2>7. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>We utilize **RevenueCat** to manage in-app subscriptions. RevenueCat may collect anonymized data such as purchase history, product interaction, and device information. This data is used solely for App functionality, analytics related to subscriptions, and fraud prevention. It is **not used for tracking across apps or for advertising purposes**.</p>

  <h2>8. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify users of significant changes by updating the "Last updated" date above. Your continued use of the App after any changes signifies your acceptance of the revised Privacy Policy.</p>
